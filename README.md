Learned more about using Bootstrap and it's class names. Learned about using JavaScript to create a dark navbar when the user does an action, in this case scrolling. I focused on using divs within divs for creating space and properly using margin and padding throughout. Also learned about "background-position: center center;" in CSS that takes a image and centers it even if the page changes sizes, great for responsive full image hero websites. Tried to learn the hamburger on smaller screens trick but couldn't figure it out so going to come back when I've learned more JavaScript. Overall I really enjoy using Bootstrap, very similar to Tailwind but MUCH easier to work with and load in, although doesn't seem as customizable.
